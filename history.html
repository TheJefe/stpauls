              Standing at 104 West Maine Street in the
              Monongahela business district, St.
              Paul&#8217;s is the oldest Washington County
              church in the mid-Mon Valley.  First know as
              Parkinson&#8217;s Ferry because of
              the river crossing service proved by
              that family and later called
              Williamsport, Monongahela is an old
              river town where boat building, coal
              mining and steel fabrication dominated
              a diverse industrial economy.
              Beginning in the 1960&#8217;s, the area has
              been hit hard by mine and steel plant
              closings.  Over the years, people of many different
              ethnic backgrounds came to the region
              and have changed St. Paul&#8217;s

              What reach to a large ecumenical
              congregation in the Presbyterian
              Church.  It was almost a year later that
              Dr. Lee returned and began occasional
              visits that continued through 1862.
              During 1862, Fr. Edward M. Van Duesen
              of St. Peter&#8217;s, Pittsburgh also
              visited at Monongahela.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              In July1862, the Western
              Convocation of the Diocese of
              Pennsylvania met in Monongahela, using
              the local highschool auditorium.
              At this meeting, Fr. William P. TenBroeck
              was appointed missionary in the
              Valley.

              On August 9, 1863, Bishop
              William Stevens, coadjutor of the
              Diocese of Pennsylvania, made his
              first visit and confirmed four. Bishop
              Alonzo Potter came in October of that
              year and confirmed eight.
              In November 1863, Bishop Potter presided
              at the Second Western Convocation in
              Monongahela. During that time, he
              organized the first vestry.  Those elected included William Manown, R. M.
              Gee, Francis Nelson, James Sheplar,
              John Markell, R. L. Robin&shy;son and
              E. W. Crittenden. At that time, $220 was pledged toward
              construction of a sanctuary. Families active in establishing the church
              included the Stuarts, Sheplars,
              Robinsons, Markells, Parkinsons,
              Wests, Keys, Kerns, Collins and Hills.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              Father Henry Mackay, who had
              been serving Georgetown in the Ohio
              Valley, agreed to come to Monongahela
              and begin his duties immediately. During
              the spring of 1866, not long after his
              consecration as the new bishop of the
              Diocese of Pittsburgh, John B. Kerfoot
              made his first visit to the area. He
              brought great encouragement to the new and
              uncertain congregation. He
              returned September 3, 1866 to lay the
              cornerstone of the present church. The
              stone, itself, was given by Godfrey Kern, who
              owned a nearby quarry. The stone was
              cut, dressed and laid by members of
              the par&shy;ish. Father Mackay
              resigned his charge in the fall of
              1869 to start a new congregation at
              Brady&#8217;s Bend. Father John Linseka succeeded him in March
              1870.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              The new sanctuary was completed
              during 1870. Gothic in design, with eighteen-inch thick,
              gray native stone, the nave was 60 by
              36 feet and the chancel 21 by 14 feet.
              The congregation used the building for
              worship before the interior walnut
              wainscoting and other woodwork were
              completed. The altar was later
              dedicated in memory of Bishop Kerfoot.
              When Fr. Linseka was deposed from the
              priesthood in October 1871, worship
              was suspended until March 1872.  At that time, Fr. John P.
              Norman, MD was placed in charge. During
              May 1872, Bishop Kerfoot visited the
              parish and confirmed six. The
              tower with its spire and cross was
              completed in 1873.  While
              serving the congregation, Dr. Norman
              also practiced medicine, caring for
              many poorer community members at no
              cost.  He continued as vicar until
              July 1875, when he took charge of St.
              Luke&#8217;s, Bloomfield until 1880.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              What followed was a period of
              rapid clergy turnover at St. Paul,
              which saw Frs. Percival Beckett,
              Emilius W. Smith and Thomas White come
              and go, serving only one or two years.  Finally,
              in April 1880 Fr. Norman returned to
              St. Paul&#8217;s and steady growth began.  He
              obtained an organ and developed a
              strong choir.  The Christmas and Easter cantatas became
              annual civic events. During his long,
              stable pastorate, many Pittsburghers
              made excursions up river by packet
              boat on Sundays to have
              picnics at St. Paul&#8217;s and attend
              Evening Prayer.
              On June 9, 1882 St. Paul&#8217;s, now
              debt-free, was consecrated by Bishop
              Whitehead, who confirmed nine.  Dr. Norman organized and
              sponsored cricket matches and soccer
              games.  In addition to serving on the
              school board, he was active in Masons
              and the Grand Army of the Republic,
              and still found time to write book
              reviews that were published in
              Pittsburgh.  He established an excellent Sunday school
              that numbered more than 100.  Something
              of a character, the good doctor loved
              chewing tobacco and drank his coffee
              scalding hot.  One year, even with a broken leg he
              celebrated the Eucharist and baptized
              infants. No other priest served St.
              Paul&#8217;s so effectively for so long.  Along
              the Monongahela River he gathered and
              ministered to congregations from
              Homestead to McKeesport to
              Brownsville.  He retired at 82 in 1918, dying in 1923.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              The Rev. Lewis H. Huber arrived
              as pastor in 1918. During
              his term, he organized the Boys'
              Brigade, St. Agnes Missionary Guild
              and St. Paul's Altar Guild. The
              first members of the Altar Guild were
              Mmes. Huber, W. I. Jones, Charles
              Frye, James Crall, Frank Myers,
              William Pursglove, T. J. Eckbreth, S.
              M. Down&shy;er, Morton Collins, Clyde
              Albright and James Ternent. Father
              Huber also intro&shy;duced the duplex
              envelope system for regular giving to
              missions, as well as parish support. Following
              Fr. Huber&#8217;s resignation in 1920, Fr.
              Henry McClellan then served the parish
              for three years.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              In 1924, Fr. William Bayle came
              to St. Paul's. The
              parish house was built on the hill
              behind and adjoining the church. A
              severe coal strike hit the community
              and local relief efforts were
              coordinated there. The
              National church surveyed the local
              conditions, bringing added recognition
              to the congregation&#8217;s community
              outreach. During a visit by the
              Brothers of St. Barnabas in 1924, the
              outdoor manger scene was first
              erected.  The Brothers came every year at
              the start of Advent to preach and
              erect the manger for many years. It
              is believed to be the oldest manger
              scene in continuous use in the Mon
              Valley. Father Bayle, an effective if
              somewhat crusty character, when
              challenged by the spouse of a vestry
              member with the question &#8220;Who was it
              who founded the Episcopal Church?&#8221;
              replied, &#8220;Why, Madame, Jesus Christ
              himself.&#8221; He


              left St. Paul&#8217;s in 1927 to become
              Archdeacon. 
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              During the Depression and World
              War II years, St. Paul&#8217;s experienced a
              high rate of clergy turnover, with
              eight priests coming and going. Arriving
              in 1949, Fr. Ward Smith was the first
              of a crop of newly ordained young men
              who served their first tours of duty
              in Monongahela. From
              1955-57, Fr. Richard W. Davies served
              as vicar. Then,
              after 94 years as a mission, the final
              debt on the rectory was paid, and St.
              Paul's became an independent parish. During
              Fr. Davies&#8217; pastorate, St. Paul's
              celebrated its 100th anniversary with
              publication of an extensive history
              entitled, "The Joy of Saints." In
              1957, another group of young clergy
              with short tenures followed him. Father
              Ralph Brooks is remembered because of
              his adventures as a volunteer fire
              fighter.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              During the six-year pastorate
              of Fr. Douglas Kierstead in the
              mid-1970's, the church was renovated
              and the second floor of the parish
              hall was divided into seven Sunday
              school rooms and a nursery. Sanctuary
              renovations included removing the
              wainscoting and painting the church
              white, in addition to moving the altar
              so that the priest could face the
              congrega&shy;tion. New
              pews, lighting and carpeting were
              installed. The
              original altar, pulpit, lectern,
              Bishop's chair, tabernacle and organ
              were retained and are still in use.
              Bishop Robert Appleyard rededicated
              the renovated sanctuary on Sunday,
              March 2, 1975. Father Kierstead&#8217;s
              faithful pastorate of 1970-76 was the
              longest since the retirement of Dr.
              Norman in 1917. The
              two- to four-year tenures of so many
              of St. Paul&#8217;s priests hindered parish
              growth.  Yet the years 1977-79 were
              again marked by clergy turnover. Father
              William Wilbert became so ill he had
              to resign, then died not long
              afterward. His wife Betty was a most effective parish
              secretary.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              The Adeste Fedelis Bible Class
              began a parish tradition in 1924.  An elegant English Tea,
              complete with linens, brass
              appointments, flow&shy;ers, fancy cake
              stands and teapots with cozies, serves
              English fancy cookies, tarts, breads,
              fruit&shy;cake and finger sandwiches. Offered
              on the first Saturday of November,
              this event is well attended. The
              tradition has expanded to include a
              ham dinner.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              St. Paul's has been noted for
              its community dinners.  Strawberry
              festivals were very popular in the
              early years. Fresh roasted peanuts and donuts were made
              for years, with the small girls and
              boys of the parish who delivered them
              being paid in donut holes. In
              recent years, the men of the parish
              cook breakfast for everyone the fourth
              Sunday of each month. Lenten Friday
              fish fries, a Bazaar and other
              projects are held throughout the year.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              In 1980, the Diocese yoked St.
              Paul&#8217;s and St. John&#8217;s, Donora so that
              a full-time priest might come to the
              Valley.  Father Robert Brickart
              encouraged spiritual renewal and
              developed a youth ministry during his
              four years as pastor. He resigned
              in 1984.  Two years of uncertainty
              followed, and then in 1986 another
              newly ordained man came to serve both
              parishes. Father James Hibby, who initiated a Kids Club
              ministry with his wife and
              parishioners, stayed until 1990.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              In 1990, the two parishes asked
              the Diocese to dissolve their
              partnership. The senior warden, then a student at
              Trinity seminary in Ambridge, was made
              lay reader-in-charge. This
              arrangement did not work well. The
              seminary asked the warden to withdraw
              and the Diocese removed him from the
              parish.  Bishop Appleyard appointed Fr.
              John Leggett, retired rector of
              Trinity, Washington, as interim priest
              in 1993. Like some of his interim
              predecessors, Fr. John, working three
              days a week, visited all the
              parishioners at home during his
              one-year tenure.  In 1992, St. Paul&#8217;s had
              purchased and demolished the house
              next door to the church in order to
              install new steps and a handicapped
              ramp to enter the church. A
              large illuminated sign was also
              installed in that space. Fr.
              John oversaw the completion of the
              handicapped ramp, as well as the
              re-grading and landscaping of the
              church side yard, and the installation
              of an attic-type fan for summer
              cooling.  As Diocesan historian, he began
              an update of St. Paul&#8217;s history.

              The year 1994 saw the arrival
              of Fr. Walter Syzmanski as interim
              pastor.  Under his leadership, a group
              of adult leaders gathered the youth
              and began Sunday evening Vespers and
              monthly vespers visits to St.
              Vincent&#8217;s Archabbey in Latrobe. He
              also instituted the first licensed Lay
              Eucharistic Ministers that year: Joseph
              Acton, Raymond Johnson and Florence
              Yohe.  They began taking Sunday
              communion and making visitations once
              a month to approximately 15
              parishioners who were either
              housebound or in personal care homes. Fr.
              Syzmanski&#8217;s two-day-a- week duties
              ended in 1995. During
              the following two years, supply clergy
              covered the parish.

              A new era in parish life began
              in late 1997 when the Diocese sent Fr.
              William &#8220;Jay&#8221; Geisler to St. Paul&#8217;s. A
              former Roman Catholic priest, he and
              his wife are long-time drug and
              alcohol counselors. He
              heads a Christian 12-Step Recovery
              program at the Greenbriar Treatment
              Center in Washington. He
              served the parish three days a week.
              <br>
              <span style="padding-left: 5em"/>
              When Jay Geisler was called to
              other duties in the diocese in 1999,
              David Kinsey served as interim. He
              was followed by the Rev. John Fierro
              in 2000.  In 2008, many in the diocese
              voted to leave the Episcopal Church. Much
              of the congregation followed Father
              Fierro into the Anglican Church of
              North America and they remained in
              possession of the building. However, a
              group remained committed to the
              Episcopal Church.  Court
              opinions rendered in October 2009, January
              2010 and confirmed on appeal in
              February 2011 confirmed that the
              Episcopal Church owned the St. Paul&#8217;s
              Building.  In 2012 Episcopalians
              asked the Episcopal Diocese of
              Pittsburgh to provide a priest. The
              diocese sent The Rev. Walter Szymanski back to
              the parish with additional help from
              the Rev. Theresa Hunt.  The REv.
              Hunt has become the primary pastor
              to the congregation.  On
              September 7, the congregation received
              the keys to their historic
              building.  Their first worship
              service in the returned building was
              Bishop Price's visitation on Saturday,
              September 22, 2012.

              There have been only two people
              from St. Paul's to enter into the
              priesthood. James
              M. Frye, son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles
              Frye served Transfiguration Mission in
              Clairton, first as lay reader from
              1948 to 1952, then as priest from his
              1952 ordination until his death in
              1954.  The Rev. Rebecca Lepley,
              daughter of the late Clinton Baird and
              June Baird, was ordained in 1985 and
              serves at St. Mark's in Marine City,
              Michigan.

              Special mention must be made
              about two men of the parish who have
              given of their talents and time over
              the years: the late George Roul,
              Vestryman Emeritus, and Joseph
              Harrison who served both on vestry and
              as parish treasurer for many years. St.
              Paul's has one fourth-generation
              family, the Yohes. Horace Yohe
              was the parish&#8217;s first Lay Reader, and
              his mother, Nancy Yohe, the first
              organist from 1906 to the early
              1940's.  Both third and fourth
              generations are still active.
